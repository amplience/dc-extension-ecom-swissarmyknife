# BigCommerce

_NOTE: This backend does not support CORS requests - it is only available when using the middleware API. An alternate vendor [`bigcommerce-cors`](./bigcommerce-cors.md) is available that uses the Storefront GraphQL API to support product and category requests._

In order to have this extension point to your BigCommerce instance you need specific installation params, instance details and API access.
